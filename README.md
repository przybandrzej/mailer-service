# mailer-service

A service to send emails from applications from a microservices cluster.   
The service takes all emails compatibile with the [**Nodemailer**](https://nodemailer.com/) specification. To see the full Email object, go to API docs.

## Known bugs:  
 * Swagger API spec causes clients generated by Swagger Codegen CLI to not work with the API. Please use the AMQP protocol (RabbitMQ) to connect to the application. 
 * `mailer-api` service from docker-compose is not working. It is recommended to start only the `mailer_mongo_db` and `rabbit_mq` containers and the `api` from local machine.

# Getting started

## Environment  
First we need to create `.env` file. You can copy the `.env.example` file.  
To start the service (mailer-service) we neeed RabbitMQ and MongoDB instances. You can setup your own local servers or you can use the `docker-compose.yml` images (**recommended**).  

## Start  
**Dev** ::  
`npm start`  
**Prod** ::  
`npm run prod`  
## Test  
`npm test`  
## Lint  
`npm run lint`  

## Setting up mail client  
In the `.env` file add your smtp settings. When using the [Nodemailer well-known-services](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/) option, set up the **MAILER_SERVICE** variable, provide the **MAILER_USER** and **MAILER_PASSWORD**. That's all. When using normal SMTP connection, provide all the **MAIL ENVS** except the **MAILER_SERVICE**.  
All the options are equal to the Nodemailer transport options:
 * MAILER_HOST -> host
 * MAILER_PORT -> port
 * MAILER_USER -> auth.user
 * MAILER_PASSWORD -> auth.pass
 * MAILER_SECURE -> secure
 * MAILER_SERVICE -> service  
 
For more info refer to the [Nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/).
